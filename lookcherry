    Add CMS menu entry level control of forced reboot on changes
    CMS menu items can now be defined with a `REBOOT_REQUIRED` flag. If the user changes flagged elements the the exit/save options will change to `EXIT&REBOOT` and `SAVE&REBOOT` - ensuring that the changed items will be handled properly. This should be used for options where runtime changes either won't take effect (because they are read at boot), or for items that could have unexpected behavior if changed.
    
    Several appropriate menus have been updated to include the flag.
    
    To accomodate the dynamic nature of the save/exit options, the individual options have been removed from the main menu and replaced with a `SAVE/EXIT` submenu. This is the same menu that is presented as the quick-access popup save menu (yaw-right). This menu will adapt to requiring a reboot if any flagged setting is changed. Additionally the `REBOOT_REQD` arming disabled reason will be set (cleared by the reboot).

    Maximize OSD stats display lines based on video mode
    Will dynamically determine the number of active OSD stats lines that are being displayed (accounting for user selections and #define logic) and maximize the number of stats that can be displayed based on the current video format (13 for NTSC, 16 for PAL).
    
    If the number of stats is equal to or greater than the available display lines, the heading will be suppressed and used instead for an extra stats line.
    
    The entire stats page will be centered vertically based on the screen size determined by the video format.
